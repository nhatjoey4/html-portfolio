<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Nathan Nartey Mensah born in Akim Oda,Ghana. I've been coding some few months ago, this is my fourth time coding on a project work.
 <p> I hope everything goes well because i want to do more. My aims and aspirations are to became one of the best full stack engineers, well its not easy tho but with the help of Jehovah our God and a friend or lets just say a brother who goes by the name Benjamin Akorli Junior, and has been in this game for about 2years now i will be able to achieve my goals.
    Yeah i know you are wondering, well he has been in this game since 2years now but looks like he has been coding for about 10years, haha i tell you he is good.</p> 
  Wanting to become a full stck engineer isn't child's play but i hope these dreams come to past. </p>
